// lib/paths.js — location of the Python scripts, both in dev and once packaged.
//
// Why this is needed:
//   1. Scripts are invoked via a relative path ("python/train.py") and spawned
//      with no cwd. In dev this happens to work because cwd = the app folder,
//      but an installed app can be run from any folder.
//   2. Once packaged, the app's code lives inside app.asar. Python CANNOT
//      run a file that's inside that archive, so the python/ folder is
//      deliberately kept outside asar (extraResources) and resolved to
//      process.resourcesPath.
